This homework assignment was to begin the process of building my professional portfolio. Over time it will develop into a portfolio that will reflect my personality and abilities.

Starting from scratch I built the HTML and accompanying CSS, including all of the necessary assets for the page to function properly. Through this exercise I learned to importance of the use of reset.css and media queries so that the page will resize to fit the viewerâ€™s hardware. In addition I became a little more comfortable with flex box, the var function, justifying content, line spacing, how to insert links and images, and a myriad of other CSS capabilities to help in the layout of a webpage.
