        <p>
          After recently becoming an empty nester, I decided to take on a whole
          new role in life. I spent twenty one years working part time as an
          office manager while my children were in school. Now I am looking for
          a career that I will find fulfilling as a web developer. As a coding
          boot camp student at SMU, I am grateful for this chance to learn new
          technology and face new challenges and adventures. In class I am
          learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Adding this knowledge
          to the skills I learned raising three children and running an office,
          to be task oriented and excellent at time management, will make me a
          valuable employee to any company. I am excited for the opportunity to
          take the skills I have been taught and apply them.
          <br>
          <br>
          On a personal note, entertaining and being creative are my favorite
          pass time. An example of this passion is the Live Clue game I created
          using my entire home for the game board. In addition I love pugs,
          Italy, swing dancing, escape rooms, meeting new people and solving a
          good mystery.

          In this assignment I refactored an existing website to make it more
          efficient and easier to maintain by changing the html tags to semantic
          tags, adding alt tags to the images, reduced repetative coding in CSS,
          and adding notes to both the HTML and CSS files.
